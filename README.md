## 💡 **How it works?**
- The bot uses the unofficial facebook api to send and receive messages from the user.
- When having a `new event` (message, reaction, new user join, user leave chat box,...) the bot will emit an event to the `handlerEvents`.
- The `handlerEvents` will handle the event and execute the command:
  - `onStart`:
    - the handler will check if user `call a command or not`.
    - if yes, it will check if `user banned` or mode `admin box only is turned on` or not, if not, it will execute the command.
    - next, it will check the `permission` of the user.
    - next, it will check if the `countdown` of command is over or not.
    - finally, it will execute the command and `log` information to the console.

  - `onChat`:
    - the handler will run `when the user sends a message`.
    - it will check `permission` of the user.
    - the handler will `execute` the command, if it return a `function` or `async function` then it willl check `user banned` or mode `admin box only is turned on` or not, if not, it will call the function and `log` information to the console.

  - `onFirstChat`:
    - the handler will run `when get the first message` from the chat box since the bot started.
    - the way it works is like `onChat`.

  - `onReaction`:
    - the handler will run when the user `reacts` to a `message has messageID` is set in `GoatBot.onReaction` as follows:
		```javascript
		// example:	
		global.GoatBot.onReaction.set(msg.messageID, {
			messageID: msg.messageID,
			commandName,
			// ... and more
		});
		```
    - the handler will automatically add method `delete`, if this method is called, it will delete the message from the set.
    - next, it will check `permission` of the user and `execute` if the user has permission and `log` information to the console.

  - `onReply`:
    - the handler will run when the user `replies` to a `message has messageID` is set in `GoatBot.onReply` as follows:
		```javascript
		// example:
		global.GoatBot.onReply.set(msg.messageID, {
			messageID: msg.messageID,
			commandName,
			// ... and more
		});
		```
    - the handler will automatically add method `delete`, if this method is called, it will delete the message from the set.
    - next, it will check `permission` of the user and `execute` if the user has permission and `log` information to the console.  

  - `onEvent`:
    - the handler will run `when the user has a new event` type `event` (new user join, user leave chat box, change admin box,...)
		```javascript
		// example:
		global.GoatBot.onEvent.set(msg.messageID, {
			messageID: msg.messageID,
			commandName,
			// ... and more
		});
		```
		- it will loop through all `onEvent` and get the command determined by the key `commandName` and execute the `onEvent` in that command.
		- if it return a `function` or `async function` then it will call the function and `log` information to the console.

  - `handlerEvent`:
    - the handler will run `when the user has a new event` type `event` (new user join, user leave chat box, change admin box,...)
    - it will get all the eventCommand set in `GoatBot.eventCommands` (scripts placed in the `scripts/events` folder)
    - it will loop through all `eventCommands` and run the `onStart` in that command.
    - if it return a `function` or `async function` then it will call the function and `log` information to the console.
